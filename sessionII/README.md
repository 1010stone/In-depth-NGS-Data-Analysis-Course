## Session II: Introduction to Unix / O2 and NGS Data Analysis

### Description

Session II will start with a discussion of common file formats encountered during NGS analyses. We will then tackle RNA-Seq read alignment with STAR, assess the alignment quality, visualize alignments, and count the number of reads associated with genes with featureCounts. We will finish the session by introducing R, which we need to start with differential expression analysis of our count data.
