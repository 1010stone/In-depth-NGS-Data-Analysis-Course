## Session I: Introduction to Unix / O2 and NGS Data Analysis

### Description

Session I will start with an overview of bioinformatics and next-generation sequencing (NGS), followed by an interactive introduction to Unix and O2 (the high performance computational cluster maintained by HMS Research Computing). The session will wrap up with an in-depth introduction to sequencing technology, library preparation and QC protocols for NGS data.

> These materials were developed for a trainer-led workshop, but are also amenable to self-guided learning.

### Learning Objectives

1.	Understand the necessity for, and use of, the command line interface (bash) and HPC for analyzing high-throughput sequencing data.
2.	Understand best practices for designing an RNA-seq experiment and the QC of the resulting data.
