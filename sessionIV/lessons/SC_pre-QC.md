# Single-cell RNA-seq: raw sequencing data to counts

Single-cell RNA-seq is an exciting and cutting-edge method for analyzing differences in gene expression among individual cells. 
The sequencing facility and method of library preparation will determine the type of data received from the sequencing facility. The should be either in BCL format or FASTQ. The workflow for getting this raw sequencing data
