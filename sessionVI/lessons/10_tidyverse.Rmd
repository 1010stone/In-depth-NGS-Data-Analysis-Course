The [tidyverse][] is a suite of integrated packages designed to make common operations performed in [R][] more user friendly. This was initially developed by [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz), Chief Scientist at [RStudio][], but is now maintained by a number of talented developers moving the [R][] language forward.

# Installation

The core collection of tidyverse packages are managed by the [tidyverse CRAN package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyverse/index.html).

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
```

When you load the `tidyverse` library, these core packages will be loaded into your environment:

- [ggplot2][]
- [tibble][]
- [tidyr][]
- [readr][]
- [purr][]
- [dplyr][]


## Recommended optional packages

There are a number of additional [tidyverse][] packages that we highly recommend for performing data analysis, including:

- [magrittr][]: Defines the pipe operator (`%>%`), which is used to write left-to-right chain operations. We'll cover this below.
- [stringr][]: Enables easier manipulation of vectors ("strings").
- [readxl][]: Current recommended best practice for import of Excel workbooks.


## Function name conflicts

When you load the [tidyverse][], you'll see messages about tidy package conflicts at the end. *This is normal.* Currently, [dplyr][] masks `stats::filter()` and `stats::lag()` by default. What's happening here is that the [tidyverse][] has some functions with the same names as base [R][] packages.

**Note**: This remains a common issue when loading multiple libraries in a single script. For example, many [Bioconductor][] packages have generic functions with the same name as base [R][] and [tidyverse][] packages. For example, `biomaRt::select()` and `dplyr::select()` have the same function name but require different arguments. Whichever library you load last will define the function name (`select()`). If you need to use two packages with the same function name at the same time, you can reference them explicitly (e.g. `dplyr::select()`). Therefore, when starting a new analysis using [tidyverse][] packages, we highly recommend slotting `library(tidyverse)` at the end of your list of libraries.



# Code style

One problem with [R][] is a lack of consistency across packages in how functions and arguments are named.

- Base [R][] functions are formatted in dotted case: `read.csv()`.
- [tidyverse][] functions are formatted in snake_case: `read_csv()`.
- [Bioconductor][] functions are generally formatted in lowerCamelCase (and sometimes UpperCamelCase).

The [tidyverse][] collection of packages are very opinionated in this regard and consistently use `snake_case` formatting for all function names and arguments. When using these functions, we recommend that you follow the [tidy style guide][].



# tibbles

A core component of the [tidyverse][] is the [tibble][]. Tibbles are a modern rework of the standard `data.frame`, with some internal improvements to make code more reliable. Most notably, tibbles will return a more reasonable number of rows to the console.

```{r gh_data, include=FALSE}
# Download from GH to knit
results_dir <- file.path(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com",
    "hbctraining",
    "In-depth-NGS-Data-Analysis-Course",
    "may2017",
    "sessionVI",
    "results")
counts <- file.path(results_dir, "counts.txt") %>%
    read.table %>%
    as.data.frame
meta <- file.path(results_dir, "meta.txt") %>%
    read.table %>%
    as.data.frame
results <- file.path(results_dir, "results_Mov10_oe.txt") %>%
    read.table %>%
    as.data.frame
```

Before we begin the tidy workflow, coerce your counts, metadata, and DESeqResults to data frames:

```{r globalenv_data, eval=FALSE}
counts <- as.data.frame(data)
meta <- as.data.frame(meta)
results <- as.data.frame(res_tableOE)
```

Now let's create tibbles from our data frames:

```{r tibbles}
counts_tbl <- counts %>%
    rownames_to_column("ensgene") %>%
    as_tibble
meta_tbl <- meta %>%
    rownames_to_column("sample_name") %>%
    as_tibble %>%
    rename(sample_type = sampletype,
           mov_expression = MOVexpr) %>%
    mutate(sample_name = tolower(sample_name))
results_tbl <- results %>%
    rownames_to_column("symbol") %>%
    as_tibble
```

First, try returning the `counts` data frame in your console.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
counts
```

Next, try returning the counts [tibble][].

```{r}
counts_tbl
```

See how [R][] only prints 10 rows instead of returning all 38k? This is much more user friendly.

Internally, a [tibble][] is essentially a class variant of `data.frame`, with some extra tibble (`tbl`) magic baked in:

```{r}
class(meta_tbl)
```

`glimpse()` is a modern rework of `str()`, optimized for tibbles:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
glimpse(counts_tbl)
glimpse(meta_tbl)
glimpse(results_tbl)
```


## Row names

*Important*: [tidyverse][] is very opininationed about row names. These packages insist that all column data (e.g. `data.frame`) be treated equally, and that special designation of a column as `rownames` should be deprecated. [tibble][] provides simple utility functions to to handle rownames: `rownames_to_column()` and `column_to_rownames()`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
help("rownames", "tibble")
```



# Non-standard evaluation

[tidyverse][] packages improve code readability by changing how functions interpret object names. This is achieved through the use of "non-standard evaluation" instead of base [R][]'s "standard evaluation". This probably sounds confusing but is actually pretty simple. In fact, we've already used a function (`subset()`) in the class that works with non-standard evaluation.

```{r}
subset(meta_tbl, mov_expression == "high")
```

Here's the [tidyverse][] variant:

```{r}
filter(meta_tbl, mov_expression == "high")
```

See how both functions refer to the `mov_expression` column directly and not in quotations? That's *non-standard evaluation*. It makes code easier to read.



# dplyr

The most useful tool in the [tidyverse][] is [dplyr][]. It's a swiss-army knife for data manipulation. [dplyr][] has 5 core functions that we recommend incorporating into your analysis:

- `filter()` picks cases based on their values.
- `arrange()` changes the ordering of the rows.
- `select()` picks variables based on their names.
- `mutate()` adds new variables that are functions of existing variables
- `summarise()` reduces multiple values down to a single summary.

**Note:** [dplyr][] underwent a massive revision this year, switching versions from 0.5 to 0.7. If you consult other [dplyr][] tutorials online, note that many materials developed prior to 2017 are no longer correct. In particular, this applies to writing functions with [dplyr][] (see Notes section below).

Let's make a report tibble of our `DESeqResults`.


## `select()`

First, we only need a few columns of interest from our results tibble. We can do this easily in [dplyr][] with `select()`.

```{r select}
report <- results_tbl %>%
    select(symbol, baseMean, log2FoldChange, padj)
```

Conversely, you can remove columns you don't want with negative selection.

```{r neg_select}
results_tbl %>%
    select(-c(lfcSE, stat, pvalue))
```


## `arrange()`

Note that the rows are sorted by the gene symbol. Let's fix that and sort them by adjusted P value instead with `arrange()`.

```{r arrange}
report <- arrange(report, padj)
report
```


## `filter()`

Let's keep only genes that are expressed (`baseMean` above 0) with an adjusted P value below 0.01. You can perform multiple `filter()` operations together in a single command.

```{r filter}
report <- report %>%
    filter(baseMean > 0,
           padj < 0.01)
```


## `mutate()`

`mutate()` enables you to create a new column from an existing column. Let's generate log10 calculations of our baseMeans for each gene.

```{r mutate}
report %>%
    mutate(log10BaseMean = log10(baseMean)) %>%
    select(symbol, baseMean, log10BaseMean)
```


## `rename()`

You can quickly rename an existing column with `rename()`. The syntax is `new_name` = `old_name`.

```{r rename}
report %>%
    rename(gene = symbol)
```


## `summarise()`

You can perform column summarization operations with `summarise()`.

```{r summarise}
report %>%
    summarise(avgBaseMean = mean(baseMean))
```

*Advanced:* `summarise()` is particularly powerful in combination with the `group_by()` function, which allows you to group related rows together.

*Note*: `summarize()` also works if you prefer to use American English. This applies across the board to any tidy functions, including in [ggplot2][] (e.g. `color` in place of `colour`).


## `pull()`

In the recent [dplyr][] 0.7 update, `pull()` was added as a quick way to access column data as a vector. This is very handy in chain operations with the pipe operator.

```{r pull, eval=FALSE}
pull(report, symbol) %>% .[1:10]
```


## Joins

To demonstrate [dplyr][]'s powerful suite of join operations, let's import Ensembl gene annotations from the [annotables][] package and add them to our report.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("stephen_turner/annotables")
```

```{r}
library(annotables)
annotable <- grch37 %>%
    select(symbol, biotype, description) %>%
    distinct
```

```{r left_join}
report <- left_join(report, annotable, by = "symbol")
```

# Notes

## Programming

Underneath the hood, [tidyverse][] packages build upon the base [R][] language using [rlang][], which is a **complete rework** of how functions handle variable names and evaluate arguments. This is achieved through the `tidyeval` framework, which interprates command operations using `tidy evaluation`. This is outside of the scope of the course, but explained in detail in the [Programming with dplyr](http://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/programming.html) vignette, in case you'd like to understand how these new tools behave differently from base [R][].
