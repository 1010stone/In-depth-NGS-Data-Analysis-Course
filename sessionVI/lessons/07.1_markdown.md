In this lesson we will first make a personal copy of the ngs course repository by `fork`ing it. A fork in a repo is like a fork in the road, it usually doesn't meed back with the original road (repo). So, you will not get any updates we make, and any changes you make will be your own.

To fork the repo, use the "Fork" button at the top right hand corner.

Next, **change to the `May2017` branch of the repo** by clicking on the "Branch" button on the top left hand corner and selecting the other branch. 

Now, **click on the `README.md` file**. This page is what shows up when you scroll down on the main page of the repo (go back and check!); by default if you create an `README.md` file in your repo (main directory, not within a subdirectory), the content of that file will be displayed on the first page of the repo.

You are all going to **modify this README markdown** and customize it with any information that you desire (note that this repo is public). 
You can start from scratch if you prefer. As you edit it, please use some or all of the formatting examples [listed in this tutorial](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#examples). To start editing, click on the pencil icon on the right side (close to the top). 

Once you add a couple of changes, check out the preview of the changes. Does the formatting match your expectations?

After you are done with changes, commit them by clicking on the commit button down below, and make sure to add a message to remind yourself what this commit was all about.
