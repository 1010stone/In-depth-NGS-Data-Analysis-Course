In this lesson we will first make a personal copy of the ngs course repository by `fork`ing it. A fork in a repo is like a fork in the road, it usually doesn't meed back with the original road (repo). So, you will not get any updates we make, and any changes you make will be your own.

To fork the repo, use the "Fork" button at the top right hand corner.

Next, go to the main page in your own NGS-course repo and click on the `index.md` file. This page is what shows up when you scroll down on the main page of the repo (go back and check :simple_smile: ).
